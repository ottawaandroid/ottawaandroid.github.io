=======================
The Ottawa Android website and blog.

Development
===========
To run a local copy of the site while developing, execute ``jekyll server`` in the
project root directory.

You can have sass watch for file changes when working on the CSS by executing
``sass --watch css/style.scss:css/style.css --style compressed`` in another terminal.
It will automatically recomple/minify the CSS as you make changes and save the files.
