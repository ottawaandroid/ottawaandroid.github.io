It will be happening on the <strong>7th of May at the Code Factory</strong>.

We've kinda been wanting to get some people together for some Android hacking and it's been a bit tough doing any hacking at the monthly meet ups.

Some of you may have noticed that some people have really wanted to hack on Spencer Elliotts Mercury project, and I think this would be a great project for people new to Android to work on as well.  The goal is to go in with the project in it's current state and come out with a more engineered solution as well as improving the interface of the application.

You can find the project here:
http://bitbucket.org/csaunders/mercury

The important part are the issues in the tracker.  If you have Java experience, there is much of the code you can go through and help figure out features that could be added to make the project better.

If you don't have experience on Android it's not a problem.  We're hoping to have enough people who understand Android so that we can pair up and roll out some awesome features and hopefully guide you into Android development.

If you are interested, and have received the mailing list message let us know.  Otherwise, feel free to add your comments here and we will be sure to add you to the list so we can try to have an even pairing.
