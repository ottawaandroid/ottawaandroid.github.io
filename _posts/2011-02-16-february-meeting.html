This is a reminder about the next Ottawa Android meetup that will be happening on the 16th of February.

As usual the meeting will be happening at The Code Factory (246 Queen St) and starts at 6:30pm.  Feel free to show up a little bit early.

For this months meeting we will be having 2 presentations:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Introduction to PhoneGap</strong> - Simon MacDonald</li>
	<li><strong>Getting RESTful with Android</strong> - Chris Saunders</li>
</ul>
It was mentioned on the mailing list to have a sort of mentor event for introducing those new to the Android platform in a more applied manner.  So once we are done all of our presentations there may be some talk about collaborating on an open source project called Mercury (http://bitbucket.org/spencerelliott/mercury) which was started last year by Spencer Elliott.  To give a brief description of the project, it is a mercurial changeset client for Android which supports various services like Google Code, Bitbucket and other source hosting
