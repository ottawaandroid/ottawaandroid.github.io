This is a reminder to everyone that there is an Ottawa Android meeting
next week (June 16th, 2010) at The Code Factory (246 Queen St, Ottawa) and it starts at
6:30pm.

The contents of this months meeting will be:

* Rooting your Android Device - __Spencer Elliott__
* [Mercury](http://bitbucket.org/spencerelliott/mercury): A Mercurial client for Android - __Spencer Elliott__
* We will also have a short presentation from __Louis Michon__ who will be
presenting about a program he is looking into working on.

If you are interested in presenting something (parts of the API, app you
have created, etc) for the next meeting or would simply like to hack on
a project with some fresh eyes; feel free to let us know and we can
surely accommodate you.

See you all next week!
