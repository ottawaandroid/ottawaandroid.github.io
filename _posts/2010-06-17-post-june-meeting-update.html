We had a decent turnout at the last meeting, so thank you to everyone who came. We had a few presentations at the meeting.
<ul>
	<li>Rooting your Android Device (Presentation: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ow.ly/1ZPuS" target="_blank">http://ow.ly/1ZPuS</a>) – <strong>Spencer Elliott</strong></li>
	<li><a href="http://bitbucket.org/spencerelliott/mercury">Mercury</a>: A Mercurial client for Android (Presentation: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ow.ly/1ZPvM" target="_blank">http://ow.ly/1ZPvM</a>) – <strong>Spencer Elliott</strong></li>
</ul>
We also had a presentation from <strong>Louis Michon</strong>, talking about an android application/tool he is interested in creating. The tool is called <strong><em>Convoy</em><span style="font-weight: normal;">. It is a keypad replacement tool, designed to increase input efficiency, and make  input easier. The concept is to remove all the vowels from the keyboard and only show the consonants. <strong><em>Convoy</em><span style="font-weight: normal;"> would then intelligently match the the partial word with the appropriate vowels to complete it.</span></strong></span></strong>

Mr. Michon would like to hear from any interested developers or people seeking more information about the tool. You can contact him at <a title="l.michon@sympatico.ca" href="mailto:l.michon@sympatico.ca">l.michon@sympatico.ca</a>.
