We've been contacted by You i Labs about placing up some opportunities they have available for Android developers in the Ottawa Area. The guys at You i are doing some pretty interesting projects, and I wouldn't be surprised if these opportunities involve getting right down to the source level of Android and hacking the hell out of it.

If you are interested in any of these positions you can get a hold of the You i Labs team by sending your resume to [info@youilabs.com](mailto:info@youilabs.com)
