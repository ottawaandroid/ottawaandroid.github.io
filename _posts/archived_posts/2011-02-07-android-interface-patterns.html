While reading up on Hacker News I came across a useful site that covers several UI Design Patterns.  The site is still in "Beta", so expect more content to be delivered every few weeks.

﻿http://www.androidpatterns.com/

GoogleIO also had a nice presentation from 2010 that talked about UI Design patterns as well.  If you are looking to improve your UIs this is probably another good article to look at as well.
