This is a reminder to everyone that there is an Ottawa Android meeting this week (November 17th, 2010) at The Code Factory (246 Queen St, Ottawa) and it starts at 6:30pm.

The contents of this months meeting will be:

* NDK and build-tree - **Michael Richardson**
* Papyrus Project - **Marc Meszaros**

We are still looking for more presenters, so if you are working on any projects at the moment and would like to show it off, please do!

If you are interested in presenting something (parts of the API, app you have created, etc) for the next meeting send us an <a title="email" href="mailto:organizers@ottawaandroid.ca">email</a> so that we can add you to the list of presentations.
