Today was the first meeting for the Ottawa Android developers. We had a grand total turnout of 4!! I would like to thank everyone who came out and hope to see you in at the next meeting.

Some project ideas that were proposed at the meeting were:
<ul>
	<li>Twitter Client – because you can never have enough twitter</li>
	<li>Pomodoro Timer – current implementations for Android Pomodoro applications aren’t that great</li>
	<li>Book Lending App – to help make keeping track of those book stealers easier</li>
</ul>
If you want a copy of the slides you can grab them <a href="/files/welcomeSlides.pdf">here</a>.
