Firstly, I would like to thank everyone who came out this month!  It was a small group, but still very interesting.

[Chris Saunders](http://www.christophersaunders.ca) gave a short presentation on integrating analytics into your Android applications using [Localytics](http://www.localytics.com).

As was mentioned at the meeting, we will be willing to promote Android applications on the Ottawa Android website.  All we ask is that the developer present their app and something that they used within their application.  This can be parts of the Android API or integrating with another service.

Check out the apps, send in your suggestions, feedback and/or feature requests.
