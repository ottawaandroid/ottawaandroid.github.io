Thanks for everyone who came out to this months meeting. I hope we have the same awesome turnout next meeting. Next months meeting should be back on on our regular schedule (3rd Wednesday of the month).

Check out the "<a title="Past Presentations" href="http://ottawaandroid.ca/presentations/">Past Presentations</a>" for links to slides and source code from past presentations.

We shall be posting more info about the next droidhack on the mailing list and online soon. As always, if you are interested in presenting something for a future meeting, suggest a presentation topic/idea on the mailing list or email the organizers.
