I'm beginning to work on an STO application from an API that was created by <a href="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</a>.  The data was stored in a pretty big JSON file, and I decided that instead of breaking it into smaller pieces I would simply insert everything into an SQLite database.  Previously the only time I had worked with Android databases had simply been via insertions with ContentValues, which is a lot slower than I had thought at first.

Previously this is what I was doing
<pre id="java" class="prettyprint">
void insertData(List<Foo> objects, SQLiteDatabase db) { 
    ContentValues cvs = new ContentValues();
    for(Foo obj : objects){
        cvs.put("FooStringColumn", obj.fooString());
        cvs.put("FooIntegerColumn", obj.fooInteger()); 
        long result = db.insertWithOnConflict("Foo", null, cvs, SQLiteDatabase.CONFLICT_REPLACE);
    }
}
</pre>

This works alright, though when you are generating thousands of entries from your JSON data it results in something that's so slow it's painful.  At first I thought my problems were stemming from using the <code>org.json</code> tools included in Android so I switched over to using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/">Google GSON</a> instead, which did help reduce a ton of unnecessary garbage collection.  Though, everything was still slow.

My database knowledge isn't extremely deep, and I recall being able to compile <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatements</a> to speed up interaction with the DB.  After a bit of searching on the internet I came across an alternative way of doing database insertion using this thing known as an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/DatabaseUtils.InsertHelper.html">InsertHelper</a>.  Using an InsertHelper is pretty straightforward, though it requires writing a bit more code than ContentValues, but it's way faster.

<pre id="java" class="prettyprint">
void insertData(List<Foo> objects, SQLiteDatabase db){
    InsertHelper helper = new InsertHelper(db, "Foo");
    final int fooStrCol = helper.getColumnIndex("FooStringColumn");
    final int fooIntCol = helper.getColumnIndex("FooIntegerColumn");
    for(Foo obj : objects){
        helper.prepareForInsert();
        helper.bind(fooStrCol, obj.fooString());
        helper.bind(fooIntCol, obj.fooInteger());
        helper.execute();
    }
}
</pre>

To also help speed things up, I extracted all of my data first then inserted everything in a transaction.  This helped reduce overhead and I was able to get the database initialized in about 10 seconds.  Surely I can speed it up further, but for now this seems to solve my problems.
