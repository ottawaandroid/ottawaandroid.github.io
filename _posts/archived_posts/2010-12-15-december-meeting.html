Our meeting for December will be on the 15th and starts at 6:30pm.

There currently aren't any presentations planned, but please feel free to come out and show off a project you are working on, or a new technology you've started using within your Android development.

Also, if anyone has started looking into the Gingerbread SDK and would like to talk about some of the new features that have been added, that would be great!
