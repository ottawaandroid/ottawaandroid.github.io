Hey Ottawa Android devs!

Our next meeting is going to be on the 21st of April from 6:30pm to 8:30pm. It will be at the same location as last time (The Code Factory, 246 Queen St.)

There are no planned presentations for this meeting, but feel free to come out if you have something you would like to demo or just to hack on a project you may be working on.

If you would like to do a demo feel free to send a message to the <a href="mailto:ottawaandroid@librelist.com">mailing list</a> and let us know what you will be presenting.

<strong>Please remember to bring a 5 dollar donation for The Code Factory “cookie jar”</strong>
