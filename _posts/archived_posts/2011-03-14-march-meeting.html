This is a reminder about the next Ottawa Android meetup that will be happening on the 16th of March.

As usual the meeting will be happening at The Code Factory (246 Queen St) and starts at 6:30pm. Feel free to show up a little bit early.

For this months meeting we will be covering:
<ul>
    <li><strong>AnDevCon Summary</strong> â€“ Chris Saunders</li>
</ul>

After this presentation, unless anything else comes up we will look into <a href="http://bitbucket.org/spencerelliott/mercury">Mercury</a> or another project and perhaps provide a few patches for it.
