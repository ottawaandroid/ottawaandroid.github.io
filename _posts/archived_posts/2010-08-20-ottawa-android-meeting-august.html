Thanks to every who came out to the last Ottawa Android meeting, it was quite interesting.

We had a presentation from Chris Saunders who is working on a simple image caching framework to make getting images into your views easier as well as to store downloaded images on disk to reduce bandwidth usage.  The code is not quite ready yet, but should be out soon.

BradS4 (Sorry, I forgot your last name) did a presentation on an extremely awesome persistence framework he's working on for Android.  It's inspired by the Hibernate persistence framework and will hopefully get us all away from having to write that boilerplate code that we've all been doing for our applications.  This should also be coming out soon, so be sure to get a copy of the source once you have it and use it!

The next meeting will be on the 15th of September.

See you then!
