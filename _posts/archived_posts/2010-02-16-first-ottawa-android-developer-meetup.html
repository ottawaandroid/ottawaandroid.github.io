Tomorrow is going to be the first monthly meeting for Android developers in the Ottawa-Gatineau area. The meeting is happening at The Code Factory which is at 246 Queen St, right above the Green Papaya.

Since this will be the first meeting, we will only be covering what we want the goals of these meetings to be, project ideas, and so on. Feel free to come out with ideas for any projects you would be interested in doing.

Some ideas we currently have in mind:
<ul>
	<li>Presentations around usage of the Android API</li>
	<li>Hack-a-thons / Projects</li>
	<li>Flash talks covering personal projects or new technologies for Android applications</li>
</ul>
