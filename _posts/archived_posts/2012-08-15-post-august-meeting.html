As always, thanks to everyone who came out to the meeting tonight. I don't know about other meeting attendees, but I know I learned a lot about Google Play in-app billing thanks to David. I also learned a fair amount of new things thanks to Christopher's presentation on Maven/Robolectric/Mockito.

If you are interested in presenting at the meeting, suggest a topic on the mailing list or fire off an email to the organizers.

Hope to see you all at the next meeting (or droidhack).
