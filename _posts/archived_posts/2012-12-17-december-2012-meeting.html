Decembers meeting will be an extra special one!

<strong>Schedule</strong>
<ul>
	<li>We are going to be having <a href="https://twitter.com/mattieuga">Matt Gammache-Asselin</a> do a remote presentation on the <a href="https://parse.com/products/data">Parse API &amp; Android SDK</a> and how you can use it to build your own cloud backed Android apps!</li>
	<li>John Stewart is going to be talking about his NDK backed android app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.freex3d">FreeX3D</a> that he recently published to the play store. It uses OpenGL and 3D meshes to let you preview your models before you export write them out with your 3D printer.</li>
</ul>
We are still accepting more presentations, and if you have any questions/subject matter you'd like covered for the Parse API let us know!

If you have any questions you would like to ask about Parse, write them as comments to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawaandroid/comments/13gypw/december_meeting_19_dec_630pm_shopify_offices_in/" target="_blank">this reddit post</a>. Upvote comments you want answered. We'll get Matt to answer the top voted questions.

We are going to be starting this one at 6:30 sharp so we aren't keeping Matt waiting for too long, so try not to be late!
