We all remember the Google I/O keynote video where some cool features were unveiled. It seemed like most of those features would only come in the next version of Android (Gingerbread). Well it seems like Google had a small surprise on Thursday.

Google held a small press conference to announce a new application. The application basically replaces the voice to text functionality inside your phone and adds and awesome new feature called <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/voice-actions/index.html">Voice Actions</a>. The interface and functionality seems identical to what was show in the Google I/O keynote back in May.

A little tip for those who didn't know: you can bring up voice to text (and now voice actions) almost anywhere, by pressing and holding the search button on the phone.

The only downside is that you need Android 2.2 (Froyo) installed to be able to use this.
