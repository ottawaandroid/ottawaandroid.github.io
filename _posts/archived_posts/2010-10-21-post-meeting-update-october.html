We would like to thank everyone who came out to this months meeting.  It was a record in both numbers and those who are working on projects for Android including on the platform itself!

We would like to thank Chris and James for their presentations and making them [immediately available for hosting on github](http://www.github.com/csaunders/Android-Tutorials/).

If you have anything you would like to present for next month send us an [email to the organizers](mailto:organizers@ottawaandroid.ca) or [on the mailing list](mailto:ottawaandroid@librelist.com).
