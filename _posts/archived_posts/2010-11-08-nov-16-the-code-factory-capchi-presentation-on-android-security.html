CapCHI will be doing a presentation on Android security.  It's the day before our next meeting, but it's at the same location which is pretty convenient.

Anyway, here's the details about the event:

## Usability and Security  of Android, Google's Open Source Smartphone System ##

Date: Tuesday November 16, 2010

Time: 6:00pm

**Place: TheCodeFactory, 246 Queen St., Ottawa**

See http://www.capchi.org/events

**Abstract:**

The adoption of Android-based smartphones is growing at a rapid pace (nearly 200,000 activations per day) which has placed Google among the top smartphone system vendors worldwide. Despite Android's open source nature, there are a number of security and usability issues that have yet to be addressed. This talk will cover issues related to security prompts and notices on the device, permission granting, smudge attacks and application security. We will discuss how these issues affect other platforms as well, including Apple iOS, Blackberry, and Symbian.

**Speaker Bio:**

David Barrera is a 1st year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Carleton University under the direction of Paul Van Oorschot. His research interests include smartphone and mobile OS security, data visualization, network security and IPv6.

**When and Where:**

This event will take place on Tuesday, November 16, 6:00pm at TheCodeFactory, located at 246 Queen Street, between Bank and Kent, (on the second floor) above the Green Papaya Restaurant.
