If you are going to be presenting and would like to share your source code with others, we have set up an [Android Tutorials](http://github.com/csaunders/Android-Tutorials) repository on Github.  Feel free to create a fork of the project and add your changes to it and we'll do our best to keep all the changes merged in and up to date.

We ask that contributions be kept under fairly liberal licenses to keep things simple for everyone.
