We would like to thank everyone who came out to this months meeting.

This month **Michael Richardson** did a presentation on getting a native service running on an Android device along with several pitfalls he ran into while working on that demo project.  He also showed off what is required in order to start developing on the Android platform.

We also had **Marc Meszaros** present his University project called "Papyrus" which is an application for keeping track of who has your books.
