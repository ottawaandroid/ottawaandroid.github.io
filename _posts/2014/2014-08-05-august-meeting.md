Slight change of plans this month. Our presenter Noyan Balay will be unable to present as he is off to NYC to start a new job. 
Please join me all in wishing Noyan all the best in his new challenge.

So this month [Carson Brown](https://twitter.com/carson_) will be leading us in a code-up. Bring some Android project you want to work on and collaborate 
with other members and get to know them. If you don't have a project you can always look at 
[Porter](https://github.com/ottawaandroid/porter) an app for requesting the Shopify Lounge door open.
