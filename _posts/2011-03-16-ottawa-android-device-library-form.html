Have you ever had issues on a specific platform and been unable to verify the problems because you don't have the device? Wish you could just borrow a device for an hour so you can debug a minor issue? Well, we're going to be creating a device library where you and fellow Android developers can add their devices to a device library.

Although it isn't necessary to add your email address and twitter account, we do suggest that you have at least one so that other developers can get in contact with you if they need to test against your device.

You can add your device to the library by <a href="https://spreadsheets0.google.com/viewform?hl=en&hl=en&formkey=dE0tVXljZmJqOFI0cWN6eUNOQVdtbUE6MQ#gid=0">filling out this form</a>
