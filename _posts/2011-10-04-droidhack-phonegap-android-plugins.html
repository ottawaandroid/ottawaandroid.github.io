The next DROIDHACK event will be happening <strong>Saturday October 8th starting at 10am</strong>.  This will be another themed hack event. Nitobi (the guys that made PhoneGap) are going to be sponsoring the event (we'll have some t-shirts &amp; stickers to pass out) and we'll be focusing on creating more PhoneGap plugins. You'll learn how to write PhoneGap plugins as well as how you can plug native bindings into a WebKit view on various platforms, such as Android.
