November 21st starting at 6:30pm

Shopify (Protoss Boardroom) - 126 York St (Back Doors With the Unicorns on them)
Ottawa, Ontario

This month (and subsequent months) we'll be meeting in the Shopify Protoss Boardroom. We shouldn't have to worry too much about any future scheduling conflicts.

We really don't have much on the schedule, so feel free to let us know that you are interested in presenting something.

<strong>Schedule</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Chris Saunders or Carson Brown -- Beermon: For monitoring your beer.. mon.</li>
	<li>Antoine Grondin - Demo of an application he's been working on</li>
</ul>
Other than that, we'll just hack on some projects for a little while.
