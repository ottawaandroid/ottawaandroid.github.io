Instead of having our monthly Droidhack this month, we decided to promote the OpenData Ottawa hackfest going on this weekend on December 3rd. The concept is the same as our Droidhacks except that the goal is to use the City of Ottawa's open data sets for interesting/creative purposes.

Hurry up and signup!
