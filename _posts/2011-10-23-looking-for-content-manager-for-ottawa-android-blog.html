We'd really like to get some more activity up on the blog, but we need a few more volunteers to help out.

Most of the responsibilities would be to find various Android dev related posts and simply share them on the blog.

The only real requirement is that you follow a number of Andorid blogs, reddits (android dev related), etc and are willing to re-share, post them on the blog.  If you're willing to create content that's awesome too.  This could be getting guest bloggers to write articles, etc.

Contact <a href="mailto:organizers@ottawaandroid.ca">organizers@ottawaandroid.ca</a> if you are interested.
