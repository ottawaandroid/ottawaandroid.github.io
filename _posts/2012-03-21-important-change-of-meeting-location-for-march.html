Hey Everyone,

There's been a scheduling mishap and all the rooms are booked at the
Code Factory. I've gotten us some space at the Cock and Lion on
Sparks St and we'll have a projector so we can still enjoy the
presentationy goodness.

The place is a bit of tricky to find if you don't know what you're
looking for hopefully this google link will help you out :)
