From the Mailing List:

<em>I've mentioned this in the past and was wondering if anyone would be interested in changing the meeting dates.  I'm personally interested because our meetings also occur on the same day as the Dirty Rectangles fellows which I've been wanting to go to for a while now.

We could perhaps move it from the 3rd Wednesday to the 3rd Tuesday of the month or would people prefer something else?  These changes probably won't happen for another month or two.</em>

Please join in the conversation on the <a href="mailto:ottawaandroid@librelist.com">mailing list</a>.
