We would like to thank everyone who came out to this months DROIDHACK 2 event.  There was a great turn out, though some thought there would be presentations.  We hope that next month, you all come back (laptops in hand!) and are ready to hack on some Android.  If there are some newbies looking to get into Android we can always have someone organize a workshop for getting the basic environment setup.  Also, perhaps we can get you hacking on something a bit more substantial that a Hello World application.

We also got to see some neat projects that others are working on and hope that you all come out to the next one to further work on your projects.

Finally, we would like to thank Macadamian for letting us use their space for the day!
